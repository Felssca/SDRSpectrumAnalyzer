* RTL SDR SpectrumAnalyzer turns a RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a spectrum analyzer
* 
* This spectrum analyzer, though, is specifically designed for detecting reradiated
* signals from humans. These are frequencies that are transmitted and could have intentional
* and unintentional biological effects.
* 
* The signals generate electrical currents in humans, and could have biological effects
* because of our electrochemical systems that use biologically generated electrical currents.
* 
* These radio/microwaves are reradiated, the electrical currents that are produced generate
* another reradiated electromagnetic wave. So they are detectable.
* 
* This rtl sdr spectrum analyzer then is designed for automatically detecting these reradiated signals.
* 
* Uses RTLSDRDevice.DLL for doing the frequency scans
* which makes use of the librtlsdr library: https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr
* and based on that library's included rtl_power.c code to get frequency strength readings
